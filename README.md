### Key Concepts & Patterns

1. **Next.js App Router**

   - Pages live in `src/app/**/page.tsx` with optional nested directories for routes like `/home`, `/services`, etc.
   - `src/app/layout.tsx` sets up global fonts and wraps content in `ConditionalLayout`, which inserts the navigation and footer on all routes except `/`.

2. **Component Organization**

   - `src/common` holds shared layout components (Navbar, Footer).
   - `src/components` contains feature-rich components (hero animations, parallax sections, 3D elements) and a `ui` subfolder of headless UI primitives derived from Shadcn.
   - Many heavy or browser-specific components are loaded with `next/dynamic` and gated behind `ClientOnly` to avoid server/client mismatches.

3. **Styling & Utilities**

   - Tailwind CSS is the primary styling mechanism; custom colors, fonts, and animations are configured in `tailwind.config.js`.
   - The `cn` utility (in `src/lib/utils.ts`) merges Tailwind class strings.
   - Global typography rules reside in `src/styles/typography.css`.

4. **Custom Hooks**

   - `src/hooks` and root-level hooks provide reusable logic, e.g., detecting backdrop-filter support, responding to motion preferences, building a toast system, or gating rendering to the client.

5. **Testing**

   - Jest and Testing Library are configured via `jest.config.js` and `jest.setup.js`.
   - Tests live under `tests/`, with helpers in `tests/test-utils.ts` that mock Next.js router, IntersectionObserver, etc.

6. **Helper Scripts**

   - The `helper` directory contains scripts for managing assets (e.g., downloading portfolio images) and a standalone `utils.ts` for non-app code.

7. **Guidelines & Documentation**
   - `CONTENT_GUIDELINES.md`: writing style (clear, 8th-grade reading level, no marketing fluff).
   - `CRUSH.md`: commands and coding conventions (Tailwind usage, TypeScript strictness).
   - `PORTFOLIO_CONSISTENCY_CHECK.md` and `SUGGESTED_CHANGES.md`: notes on content consistency and suggested UI improvements.

### Next Steps for Deepening Understanding

- **Explore the App Router**

  - Start with `src/app/home/page.tsx` to see how major sections (Hero, Features, Process, DevelopmentTools) come together.
  - Look at `ConditionalLayout` and `BrowserCompatibilityDetector` for global app behavior.

- **Understand Components & Animations**

  - Study `src/components/Hero.tsx` (Framer Motion, dynamic imports, text animations).
  - Explore `src/components/services/` and `src/components/portfolio/` for feature-specific UI.
  - Review 3D examples like `ModernCube.tsx` or `RotatingCube.tsx` using React Three Fiber.

- **Learn Custom Hooks**

  - `use-backdrop-filter-support.ts`, `use-reduced-motion.ts`, `use-safari-detection.ts`, etc., show how environment-specific logic is encapsulated.

- **Check Testing Practices**

  - `tests/components/ModernCube.test.tsx` and `ParallaxTestimonials.test.tsx` demonstrate component testing with mocked libraries and helpers.

- **Follow Guidelines**
  - Adhere to the style and content rules in `CRUSH.md` and `CONTENT_GUIDELINES.md` when adding code or copy.
