# Content Guidelines for DevX Apps

## Core Principles

- **No market fluff or generic content** - Avoid buzzwords and hyperbolic language
- **8th grade reading level** - Use simple, clear language everyone can understand
- **Respect users' time** - Provide what they need in the easiest way possible
- **Function over marketing** - Focus on what the product does, not sales language
- **Impress the users by stunning custom animations and content** - Focus on animations and asthetic so users wish to have a similar performant yet stunning unique web app

## Language Guidelines

### Words to Avoid → Better Alternatives

- "revolutionize" → "improve"
- "dominate your market" → "help you compete"
- "bulletproof" → "reliable"
- "unstoppable" → "effective"
- "supercharge" → "speed up"
- "transform" → "change" or "improve"
- "cutting-edge" → "modern" or "new"
- "game-changing" → "helpful" or "useful"
- "unleash" → "use"
- "harness the power" → "use"
- "boldest ideas" → "your ideas"
- "strategic edge" → "advantage"
- "exponentially" → "significantly" or remove entirely

### Writing Style

- Use concrete benefits instead of abstract claims
- Start with what the user gets, not what we do
- Keep sentences short (max 20 words)
- Use active voice ("We build apps" not "Apps are built")
- Avoid technical jargon unless necessary
- Test readability at 8th grade level

### Content Structure

- Lead with the benefit to the user
- Follow with how it works (briefly)
- End with specific features or results
- Use bullet points for easy scanning

## Implementation

Apply these guidelines consistently across all apps to maintain quality and user trust. Review existing content regularly and update to match these standards.

### After (Clear & Simple):
